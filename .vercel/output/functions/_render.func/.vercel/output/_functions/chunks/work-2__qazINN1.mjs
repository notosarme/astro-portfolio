We learnt this medium from scratch, and were even able to get in contact with one of the lead developers in New Zealand to discuss the app and get access to the API for easier development.

Itâ€™s theorized the main problem is that the metal of the building and aircrafts interfered with the beacons. However, the testing we did with the devices is still very good and could theoretically be used within other museums in the future. For the CASM, we ended up using NFC tags to activate tour stops instead. While requiring more user interaction than beacons, they are still easier for those with little or no vision to activate with proper accessible signage, as it just requires tapping the phone rather than QR codes requiring the camera be properly lined up.</p>\n<p>A fully functioning and tested app was passed over to Ingenium in April for their further development, such as adding French language support.
