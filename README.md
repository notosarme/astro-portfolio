# Portfolio made using Astro

When looking up different frameworks, I came across this one, which emphasizes content creation by using Markdown and templates. It was really interesting, so I gave it a go by making a simple portfolio.

I like the re-usability a lot, but I ran into problems where the things I wanted to show off just didn't work in the template-format that easily. While there's surely ways around tweaking templates to your exact specifications, for what this portfolio was meant to be, it felt like a bit more work than necessary.

Still, it was a really interesting experiment, and I think it would be a good option in the future for a project that could take advantage of the format, particularly moving my WordPress blog over to Astro.

That is a future project, however. Please enjoy this one for what it is now.
